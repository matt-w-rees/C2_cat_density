This repository contains data and code used for the analysis of this submitted manuscript. 

## Running the code
All analyses were conducted in R, numbered scripts (reflecting the order to run scripts in) are contained in the 'r_scripts' folder. 
The 'raw-data' folder contains camera-trap species records, shapefiles and Lower Glenelg cat capture-histories (this data was extracted separately). Individual cat images are also contained in this repository, but not pushed to github (due to size limits).
The 'derived-data' folder contains secr habitat masks and capture histories produced in R scripts 1:3. 
Glenelg and Otway secr models are fitted separately (script 4 and 5, respectively - but there is no need to run script 4 before 5).
